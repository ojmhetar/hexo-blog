That feeling knowing that you are better, more capable, more knowledgable NOW than you were ... 5 years ago, a year a go, or even yesterday? I know you're familar with it. Maybe not every skill you have has grown; perhaps some of the skills have remained staignant, infact so may have even vanished. How, then, do we choose which skills to maintain, keeping within our reach that they don't slip?
<br />
Alright, enough of that. 
<br />
I was having a tough time, etc, etc. Ultimately, I figured out some things. One, I felt that I wasn't working towards something bigger. Two, I wasn't growing. Three, four, just other details.
<br />
Lacking motivation wasn't the problem, it was lacking actionable items. 
<br />
One of the reasons I got hooked on weightlifting years ago was the ability to measure progress. To be able to quantify your growth. To know that you were stronger today than the day before- that was cool! 
<br />
Throughout college, I set up similar "tools" to measure my progress. For the most part, this was quite effective. 
<br />
Post-college, I still retained these tools, but my progress was non existant. I was so overwhelmed that I only daydreamt about a better situation. That I could "move" into a better situation. I felt like I had to leave and move to another place, just not here. ("here" is irrelevant)
<br />
My mindset was all wrong. I needed to work towards forming actionable items completeling them as opposed to measuring progress. The idea was to complete simple tasks, each week, each day to move towards larger goals without too much regard to performace. I took some time, and still do, to figure out where I want to be, what I want to do. 
<br />
I seperated my goals into three categories: Health/Fitness, Engineering, and Creativity. The "boxes." Now, I can't guarantee these will be the same boxes a month from now, but this is how I started. I do expect them to change overtime. 
<br />
On any given day, I must complete at least two tasks from two different categories. So far, this system has had positive effects on my overall mental health. In my next post, I'll dive deeper into this and use a specific category as an example.
